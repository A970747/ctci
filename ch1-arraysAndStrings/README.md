This week: Ch1 - Arrays and Strings

Session 1
Questions: 1.1, 1.2, 1.4

1.1 - Is Unique
Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you
cannot use additional data structures? 

1.2 - Check Permutation
Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the
other. 

1.4 - Palindrome Permutation
Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation
is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.

Session 2
Questions: 1.6, 1.7, 1.8

1.6 - String Compression: 
Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts
of repeated characters. For example, the string a a b c c c c c a a a would become a 2 b l c 5 a 3 , If the
"compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return
the original string. You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a - z).

1.7 - Rotate Matrix: 
Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is an integer, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?

1.8 - Zero Matrix: 
Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and
column are set to 0.
