This week: Ch1 - Arrays and Strings

Questions: 1.1, 1.2, 1.4

1.1 - Is Unique
Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you
cannot use additional data structures? 

1.2 - Check Permutation
Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the
other. 

1.4 - Palindrome Permutation
Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation
is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.
