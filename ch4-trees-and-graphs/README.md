Trees and Graphs
----------------

The intro is pretty dense for this chapter.
Please see text (or web search) for some basics on the topics:
Trees (in general)
-> balanced, unbalanced
-> complete, full, perfect
Binary Trees
-> Traversals: in-order, pre-order, post-order
Binary Search
Binary Heaps
Tries 
Graphs (in general)
-> adjacency list
-> adjacency matrices
Graph Search: BFS, DFS

4.1 - Route Between Nodes: 
Given a directed graph, design an algorithm to find out whether there is a route between two nodes.

4.2 - Minimal Tree: 
Given a sorted (increasing order) array with unique integer elements, write an algorithm to create a binary search tree with minimal height.

4.3 - List of Depths: 
Given a binary tree, design an algorithm which creates a linked list of all the nodes 
at each depth (e.g., if you have a tree with depth D, you'll have D linked lists)
